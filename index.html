                <h5>My Backgrount and Why I Want to Become a Web Developer</h5> 
                <p> After I got my bachelor's degree in physics, I decided to make a career shift due to the lack of jobs in this field in Gaza. I worked as a managerial assistant, a teacher, and a freelance writer. Every one of these jobs has taught me new things and enhanced my skills in some areas. And although I was successful in almost every single job I worked on, I wanted to start a career where I can grow, develop new skills, achieve my potential, and most importantly, make a positive impact on my community and build useful things. And in the same time, I wanted a high-paying job that will fulfil my financial commitments. Furthermore, I've been always passionate about working in the STEM field. I liked to solve problems, provide solutions, and build complex things. One example of that is my graduation project which was to write a code to analyze data from the LHC at CERN to try to find new subatomic particles. I really enjoyed working on that project, and I even self-learned python to be able to finish it.

                    <h5>Why I'm applaying for the Code Academy</h5> 
                    <p>I want to join the Code Academy because it will help me establish a career as a full-stack web developer. As someone who is a great self-leaner, I believe the program will help me grow fast. not only by the technical coaching it provides but also because of the career and employability support which will help me land a job and start a career faster and fill any gaps in my technical and soft skills.<br>The Code Academy is the first step to establishing my career. shortly after my graduation, I want to land a job as a junior web developer, maybe even an internship. I want to continue learning, growing, and expanding my network and hopefully earn a high salary as well. I will update my resume and start applying for companies and start-ups. Also, it would be great if I was chosen to be a mentor in the next cohorts. Nothing is more rewarding than being able to give back and support other participants as I will find support from others. In the long run, I want, someday, to confound or work with a start-up that solves a major problem or adds value to our society. </p>
